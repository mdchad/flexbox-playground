This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Flexbox playground

Build with React and styled-components

### Motivation

I was frustrated using bootstrap and react for my day job. An old friend told me why do I use bootstrap instead of flexbox.
A lot of the layout issue can be solve with flexbox rather than importing bootstrap

### What did I learn

* Flexbox
* Styled-Components
* React Hooks
